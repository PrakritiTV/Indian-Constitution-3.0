## 🌟 Why Contribute?

India’s Constitution is the soul of our democracy, guiding the lives of over 1.3 billion people. But for too long, it’s been out of reach—complex, distant, and hard to grasp. *Indian Constitution 3.0* is here to change that by:  
- **Making it Accessible**: Bringing the Constitution to every Indian’s fingertips.  
- **Tracking Change**: Logging amendments like code updates for transparency.  
- **Empowering Citizens**: Creating tools to understand rights and responsibilities.  

Your contribution—whether it’s a line of code, a design, or a simplified explanation—can light the way for millions. This isn’t just a project; it’s a movement to make "India Great Again." Ready to leave your mark?
